				<div class="column"><h3>What We Did</h3>
					<p>
						Doberman helped Dagens Nyheter design their online presence - <em>web, mobile & iOS</em>. We redesigned the web to be more engaging and to strengthen the news experience. This was achieved by increasing the news pulse, emphasizing stories and highlighting both photos as well as DN's most prominent writers. The mobile experience was redesigned from the ground up. And here the main objectives were to make all of dn.se's content available on the mobile platform and with a design that allowed the publishing to be 100% automated.

				<div class="column"><h3>The Results</h3>

				<div class="column"><h3>What We Did</h3>
					<p>
						In 2011, Doberman did a total remake of the Swedish Parliament's web site, focussing on building a website that makes the work of the Swedish Parliament transparent and understandable to the general public. Our goal was to give the visitors real insight into how our country is governed as well as the work of a politician. To that end, we put a lot of effort into integrating video and documents, such as motions and debates, in a manner that was both educational for the uninitiated public and effective for the professional user.
