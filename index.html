					<p>
						Doberman helped Dagens Nyheter to once again design their online presence - <em>web, mobile & iOS</em>. We redesigned the web to be more engaging and to strengthen the news experience with it's constant updates. We did this by increasing the news pulse, emphasizing stories, highlighting photos and DN's most prominent writers. The mobile experience was redesigned from the ground up. The main objectives was to make all of dn.se's content available on the mobile site and with a designed that allowed this process to be 100% automated.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="column"><h3>The Results</h3>
					<p>
						Since the release of the new DN mobile web site, it has more than doubled it's unique users and has been nominated for best mobile web by the Swedish Design Prize. DN’s web service was also acknowledged as Sweden’s best news site by the prominent magazine Internetworld. The financial results for DN.se after the re-design broke all previous records.
